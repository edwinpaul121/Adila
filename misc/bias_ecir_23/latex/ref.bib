abstract = {Forming teams of experts who collectively hold a set of required skills and can successfully cooperate is challenging due to the vast pool of feasible candidates with diverse backgrounds, skills, and personalities. Neural models have been proposed to address scalability while maintaining efficacy by learning the distributions of experts and skills from successful teams in the past in order to recommend future teams. However, such models are prone to overfitting when training data suffers from a long-tailed distribution, i.e., few experts have most of the successful collaborations, and the majority has participated sparingly. In this paper, we present an optimization objective that leverages both successful and virtually unsuccessful teams to overcome the long-tailed distribution problem. We propose three negative sampling heuristics that can be seamlessly employed during the training of neural models. We study the synergistic effects of negative samples on the performance of neural models compared to lack thereof on two large-scale benchmark datasets of computer science publications and movies, respectively. Our experiments show that neural models that take unsuccessful teams (negative samples) into account are more efficient and effective in training and inference, respectively.},

abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

Temporal dynamics are purely reactive, that is, they are inferred after they are observed, e.g. after a user's taste has changed or based on hand-engineered temporal bias corrections for movies. We propose Recurrent Recommender Networks (RRN) that are able to predict future behavioral trajectories. This is achieved by endowing both users and movies with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoregressive model that captures dynamics, in addition to a more traditional low-rank factorization. On multiple real-world datasets, our model offers excellent prediction accuracy and it is very compact, since we need not learn latent state but rather just the state transition function.},

@article{Goel_Kazemi_Brubaker_Poupart_2020, title={Diachronic Embedding for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion}, volume={34}, abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Knowledge graphs (KGs) typically contain temporal facts indicating relationships among entities at different times. Due to their incompleteness, several approaches have been proposed to infer new facts for a KG based on the existing ones–a problem known as &lt;em&gt;KG completion&lt;/em&gt;. KG embedding approaches have proved effective for KG completion, however, they have been developed mostly for static KGs. Developing temporal KG embedding models is an increasingly important problem. In this paper, we build novel models for temporal KG completion through equipping static models with a diachronic entity embedding function which provides the characteristics of entities at &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; point in time. This is in contrast to the existing temporal KG embedding approaches where only static entity features are provided. The proposed embedding function is model-agnostic and can be potentially combined with any static model. We prove that combining it with SimplE, a recent model for static KG embedding, results in a fully expressive model for temporal KG completion. Our experiments indicate the superiority of our proposal compared to existing baselines.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={04}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Goel, Rishab and Kazemi, Seyed Mehran and Brubaker, Marcus and Poupart, Pascal}, year={2020}, month={Apr.}, pages={3988-3995} }

abstract = {Representation learning for temporal knowledge graphs has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we study the problem of learning dynamic embeddings for temporal knowledge graphs. We address this problem by proposing a Dynamic Bayesian Knowledge Graphs Embedding model (DBKGE), which is able to dynamically track the semantic representations of entities over time in a joint metric space and make predictions for the future. Unlike other temporal knowledge graph embedding methods, DBKGE is a novel probabilistic representation learning method that aims at inferring dynamic embeddings of entities in a streaming scenario. To obtain high-quality embeddings and model their uncertainty, our DBKGE embeds entities with means and variances of Gaussian distributions. Based on amortized inference, an online inference algorithm is proposed to jointly learn the latent representations of entities and smooth their changes across time. Experiments on Yago and Wiki datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art static and temporal knowledge graph embedding models.},

Our model assumes that each user lies within an unobserved latent space, and similar users in the latent space representation are more likely to be members of the same user community. The model allows each user to adjust its location in the latent space as her topics of interest evolve over time. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model, when evaluated on a Twitter dataset, outperforms existing approaches under two application scenarios, namely news recommendation and user prediction on a host of metrics such as mrr, ndcg as well as precision and f-measure.",

The cost associated with the individuals who form a team and the quality of the tasks completed by the team are two of the main concerns in team formation problems. In this study, we consider simultaneous optimization of cost and quality in a team formation problem. Because these problems in a project usually arise in multi-period planning with uncertain parameters, a multi-objective multi-stage stochastic programming (MOMSP) model is developed and presented. Having sufficient scenarios to realistically represent real-world environments often leads to high computational complexity. Thus, we have adopted scenario cluster decomposition methods in our modeling and developed a heuristic algorithm. It is shown that the model can be solved for problems with practical size. The presented model and its solution methodology can be applied to different types of projects. In this study, a project that involves an overhaul of a set of aircraft is presented as a case study in which the goals are to minimize staffing costs and maximize the reliability of the aircraft by staffing workforce with high competency.}

Analyzing data on 312 large offices of law firms in 1991, he finds that this leverage ratio was related to business strategy, human resource management, and organizational structure. As an index of law firms' human capital structures, it also had important implications for organizational capabilities and firm competitiveness. For example, offices characterized by a rare and tightly controlled human capital structure had the highest billing rates, reflecting their capability of providing clients with services that deeply embody the knowledge of partners. }

However, most of these methodologies are centered on a development team and its internal communication.

There is another scenario: that of a single programmer working alone and often in much smaller projects and in several at the same time. Also in this scenario the client proximity is not as described by the agile environment ideal. In that case, the priorities and needs change, communication takes on another meaning and working mechanisms are not always comparable to that of a team.

Two survey studies found that people believe there is a linear and nearly monotonic relationship between talent and performance: Participants expected that more talent improves performance and that this relationship never turns negative. However, building off research on status conflicts, we predicted that talent facilitates performance—but only up to a point, after which the benefits of more talent decrease and eventually become detrimental as intrateam coordination suffers. We also predicted that the level of task interdependence is a key determinant of when more talent is detrimental rather than beneficial. Three archival studies revealed that the too-much-talent effect emerged when team members were interdependent (football and basketball) but not independent (baseball). Our basketball analysis also established the mediating role of team coordination. When teams need to come together, more talent can tear them apart. }

We show that this principled kind of regularisation yields comparable performance to dropout on MNIST classification.

To answer the question whether negative links have an added value for an online social network, we investigate the machine learning problem of predicting the negative links of such a network using only the positive links as a basis, with the idea that if this problem can be solved with high accuracy, then the "negative link" feature is redundant. In doing so, we also present a general methodology for assessing the added value of any new link type in online social networks. Our evaluation is performed on two social networks that allow negative links: The technology news website Slashdot and the product review site Epinions. In experiments with these two datasets, we come to the conclusion that a combination of centrality-based and proximity-based link prediction functions can be used to predict the negative edges in the networks we analyse. We explain this result by an application of the models of preferential attachment and balance theory to our learning problem, and show that the "negative link" feature has a small but measurable added value for these social networks.},

  abstract = 	 {Softmax classifiers with a very large number of classes naturally occur in many applications such as natural language processing and information retrieval. The calculation of full softmax is costly from the computational and energy perspective. There have been various sampling approaches to overcome this challenge, popularly known as negative sampling (NS). Ideally, NS should sample negative classes from a distribution that is dependent on the input data, the current parameters, and the correct positive class. Unfortunately, due to the dynamically updated parameters and data samples, there is no sampling scheme that is provably adaptive and samples the negative classes efficiently. Therefore, alternative heuristics like random sampling, static frequency-based sampling, or learning-based biased sampling, which primarily trade either the sampling cost or the adaptivity of samples per iteration are adopted. In this paper, we show two classes of distributions where the sampling scheme is truly adaptive and provably generates negative samples in near-constant time. Our implementation in C++ on CPU is significantly superior, both in terms of wall-clock time and accuracy, compared to the most optimized TensorFlow implementations of other popular negative sampling approaches on powerful NVIDIA V100 GPU.}

    abstract = "Learning low-dimensional representations for entities and relations in knowledge graphs using contrastive estimation represents a scalable and effective method for inferring connectivity patterns. A crucial aspect of contrastive learning approaches is the choice of corruption distribution that generates hard negative samples, which force the embedding model to learn discriminative representations and find critical characteristics of observed data. While earlier methods either employ too simple corruption distributions, i.e. uniform, yielding easy uninformative negatives or sophisticated adversarial distributions with challenging optimization schemes, they do not explicitly incorporate known graph structure resulting in suboptimal negatives. In this paper, we propose Structure Aware Negative Sampling (SANS), an inexpensive negative sampling strategy that utilizes the rich graph structure by selecting negative samples from a node{'}s $k$-hop neighborhood. Empirically, we demonstrate that SANS finds semantically meaningful negatives and is competitive with SOTA approaches while requires no additional parameters nor difficult adversarial optimization.",

abstract = {In recent years, continuous-valued word embedding learned by neural network attaches extensive attentions. Especially, Mikolov's Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and Skip-gram model optimized by Negative Sampling (NEG) achieves impressive result in capturing word semantic and syntactic information. However, the property of NEG that samples over word frequency has the drawbacks of unbalanced training and tends to decrease the training times of medium-frequency words which have greater amount of information; furthermore, words with higher frequency are less probability of being the negative samples. Focus on these issues, this paper proposed a novel NEG strategy that samples negatives based on the notion of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (NEG-TFIDF). Two ideas are included in this method. First, Negative Sampling is considers as the more effective optimization approach for learning word representation; second, the concept of TFIDF is combined to optimize Negative Sampling, which is a classic and popular method to assess the discrimination of one word for a corpus. Statistical results prove that NEG-TFIDF feasibly reduces the interference of high-frequency words that have very less information and increases the training times of medium-frequency words keeping the total training times being constant and without more calculations. The experiment results show that NEG-TFIDF outperforms Mikolov's NEG on both word analogy and word similarity test tasks, particularly in terms of the performance of medium-frequency words. Meanwhile, it also achieves better effects on NLP tasks. Moreover, NEG-TFIDF is a reasonable solution to the problem that NEG's performance decreases when the number of negative samples increases beyond a boundary value.},

title = {Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents},

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling.An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

abstract = {Pairwise algorithms are popular for learning recommender systems from implicit feedback. For each user, or more generally context, they try to discriminate between a small set of selected items and the large set of remaining (irrelevant) items. Learning is typically based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with uniformly drawn pairs. In this work, we show that convergence of such SGD learning algorithms slows down considerably if the item popularity has a tailed distribution. We propose a non-uniform item sampler to overcome this problem. The proposed sampler is context-dependent and oversamples informative pairs to speed up convergence. An efficient implementation with constant amortized runtime costs is developed. Furthermore, it is shown how the proposed learning algorithm can be applied to a large class of recommender models. The properties of the new learning algorithm are studied empirically on two real-world recommender system problems. The experiments indicate that the proposed adaptive sampler improves the state-of-the art learning algorithm largely in convergence without negative effects on prediction quality or iteration runtime.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering techniques rely on aggregated user preference data to make personalized predictions. In many cases, users are reluctant to explicitly express their preferences and many recommender systems have to infer them from implicit user behaviors, such as clicking a link in a webpage or playing a music track. The clicks and the plays are good for indicating the items a user liked (i.e., positive training examples), but the items a user did not like (negative training examples) are not directly observed. Previous approaches either randomly pick negative training samples from unseen items or incorporate some heuristics into the learning model, leading to a biased solution and a prolonged training period. In this paper, we propose to dynamically choose negative training samples from the ranked list produced by the current prediction model and iteratively update our model. The experiments conducted on three large-scale datasets show that our approach not only reduces the training time, but also leads to significant performance gains.},

The author uses the ratio of associates to partners to measure the leveraging of human assets in law firms, which he likens to the leveraging of financial capital in other firms. Analyzing data on 312 large offices of law firms in 1991, he finds that this leverage ratio was related to business strategy, human resource management, and organizational structure. As an index of law firms' human capital structures, it also had important implications for organizational capabilities and firm competitiveness. For example, offices characterized by a rare and tightly controlled human capital structure had the highest billing rates, reflecting their capability of providing clients with services that deeply embody the knowledge of partners. }

	Abstract = {In healthcare, good team building is where all team members understand, believe in and work towards the shared purpose of caring and working for patients. This sense of common purpose should never be assumed. Team leaders should talk about it at every opportunity and ensure all team members are working towards it in their day-to-day work. All teams move through different stages of development, but are at their most productive where there is openness and trust, with members working to their own strengths. Team leaders should develop a "teaming strategy" to plan how people will act and work together, including effective use of communication technology to help them make better use of face-to-face time.},

    abstract = { Five studies examined the relationship between talent and team performance. Two survey studies found that people believe there is a linear and nearly monotonic relationship between talent and performance: Participants expected that more talent improves performance and that this relationship never turns negative. However, building off research on status conflicts, we predicted that talent facilitates performance—but only up to a point, after which the benefits of more talent decrease and eventually become detrimental as intrateam coordination suffers. We also predicted that the level of task interdependence is a key determinant of when more talent is detrimental rather than beneficial. Three archival studies revealed that the too-much-talent effect emerged when team members were interdependent (football and basketball) but not independent (baseball). Our basketball analysis also established the mediating role of team coordination. When teams need to come together, more talent can tear them apart. }

abstract = {While gender diversity is slowly becoming an expected characteristic of teams, both academics and practitioners still need to better understand the relation between contextual characteristics and team composition for the performance of gender diverse teams. In this article, we investigate the relationship between diversity attitudes and the performance of gender diverse teams, and further, we show how numerical team gender composition is a key link in this relationship. Based on survey responses from 1,085 academic team leaders, we show that openness to diversity is strongly associated with team performance. We also find a moderating effect of the degree of gender diversity, so that the effect of openness to diversity, as positive team level diversity attitudes, is stronger when team gender composition converges towards numerical balance. These findings bridge critical mass theory and diversity and performance scholarship by establishing the joint effect of compositional and contextual characteristics on the performance of gender diverse teams.},

abstract = {Selecting and scheduling human experts to cooperatively solve a problem can be a highly complex task, given various constraints (such as what expertise is needed and when) and preferences (such as which expertise an expert most prefers to exercise). Computational agents can thus greatly help users form and schedule expert teams. This paper introduces a new formulation of the team formation and scheduling problem as a Hybrid Scheduling Problem (HSP) and compares the performance of an agent using the HSP formulation to a prior agent-based approach. We empirically demonstrate the promise of the HSP formulation and highlight how the application of HSP techniques to this problem has led us to identify important modifications to mechanisms that improve HSP solving. Finally, we summarize how the HSP formulation can support human-agent collaboration during the process of forming and scheduling expert teams.}

Therefore, this paper proposes Social-Temporal Group Query to find the activity time and attendees with the minimum total social distance to the initiator. Moreover, this query incorporates an acquaintance constraint to avoid finding a group with mutually unfamiliar attendees. Efficient processing of the social-temporal group query is very challenging. We show that the problem is NP-hard via a proof and formulate the problem with Integer Programming. We then propose two efficient algorithms, SGSelect and STGSelect, which include effective pruning techniques and employ the idea of pivot time slots to substantially reduce the running time, for finding the optimal solutions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms are much more efficient and scalable. In the comparison of solution quality, we show that STGSelect outperforms the algorithm that represents manual coordination by the initiator.},

It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

I briefly describe the different styles and types of collaboration and then focus on the drivers of the trend toward increased collaboration and on its consequences for both individual researchers and science more generally. Scholarship on collaboration seems partial to delineating its benefits; this review highlights the increasing body of research that focuses instead on the possible costs of collaboration. The synthesis reveals several topics that are ripe for investigation, including the impact of collaboration on the contributing authors and their work, the use of multiple methods and measures, and research integrity. I applaud a few recent efforts to overcome the perennial file-drawer problem by gaining access to collaborations that do not result in publication and thus are typically removed from public review and the research analyst's eye. }

ABSTRACT = {In this article, we study the impact of teamwork on an organization&rsquo;s performance, considering a cooperative game&rsquo;s framework. To promote teamwork culture, performance indexes were considered both individually and collectively, and by comparing the scores that every employee earned individually and collectively, their differences became obvious. In this approach, a cooperative game&rsquo;s model was used in order to improve the organization&rsquo;s performance. The proposed model, in addition to evaluating the organization and employee&rsquo;s activities, implemented all payments, including overtime pay, rewards, etc., fairly and along with increasing performance and satisfaction. The cooperative approach created effective communications between employees and authorities and enhanced their motivation for teamwork. Moreover, results could be used for decisions related to employees (such as promotion, transition, firing, and secondment), analysis of training requirements, employees&rsquo; development, and research and plan valuation. Our findings show that the collaborative coefficient (CC) is a key factor in increasing productivity and improving the efficiency of an organization in the long run. The collaborative coefficient is a new concept in teamwork that has rarely been considered in scientific research.},

In particular, gleaning demographic information about Twitter users—a key component of much social science research—remains a challenge. This article develops an accurate and reliable data processing approach for social science researchers interested in using Twitter data to examine behaviors and attitudes, as well as the demographic characteristics of the populations expressing or engaging in them. Using information gathered from Twitter users who state an intention to not vote in the 2012 presidential election, we describe and evaluate a method for processing data to retrieve demographic information reported by users that is not encoded as text (e.g., details of images) and evaluate the reliability of these techniques. We end by assessing the challenges of this data collection strategy and discussing how large-scale social media data may benefit demographic researchers. }

abstract = {Pretraining large neural language models, such as BERT, has led to impressive gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, most pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web. A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. In this article, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP benchmark from publicly available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition. To help accelerate research in biomedical NLP, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our BLURB benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding &amp; Reasoning Benchmark) at .},
